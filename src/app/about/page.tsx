Arayci is a no-code, guided solution that enables businesses to transform raw data into deployable ML and DL models at a fraction of the cost and time. It automates the end-to-end process‚Äîfrom profiling and cleaning data to feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment‚Äîdelivering exportable, cloud-ready artifacts. Unlike BI dashboards or expensive consultants, Arayci provides predictive models that drive decision-making, not just reports."
